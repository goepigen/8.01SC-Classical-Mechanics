# 8.01SC - Classical Mechanics

I completed 8.01SC from MIT OpenCourseWare and this repo contains all of my notes from the lectures and readings, solutions to problem sets, general problems, etc.

The official materials don't contain solutions to the problem sets. If you are taking 8.01SC, my solutions can be used for comparison with yours. If you find any mistakes in my solutions, please let me know!
